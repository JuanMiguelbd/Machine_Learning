# MACHINE LEARNING SKLEARN LIBRARY

In this section, i have used Sklearn library and python code in Jupyter Notebook.

## 1. Bank Marketing Data Set 

    - Data Set Information:

    The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. 

    The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).

## 2. Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set 

    - Data Set Information:

    Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at [Web Link]

## 3. Communities and Crime Data Set 

    - Abstract:
    
     Communities within the United States. The data combines socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR.

    - Data Set Information:

    Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for attributes could be tested. However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=122), plus the attribute to be predicted (Per Capita Violent Crimes). The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units. 

    The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in incorrect values for per capita violent crime. These cities are not included in the dataset. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA. 

    Data is described below based on original values. All numeric data was normalized into the decimal range 0.00-1.00 using an Unsupervised, equal-interval binning method. Attributes retain their distribution and skew (hence for example the population attribute has a mean value of 0.06 because most communities are small). E.g. An attribute described as 'mean people per household' is actually the normalized (0-1) version of that value.

## 5. Apnea-ECG Database Challenge


    The goal of this exercise is to prepare a predictive model with whichever Python library/resource (e.g. sklearn, theano, keras, tensorflow, xgboost, etc) using the Apnea-ECG Database. This dataset has been described in T Penzel, GB Moody, RG Mark, AL Goldberger, JH Peter. Computers in Cardiology 2000;27:255-258

# 6. Analisys. Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.
